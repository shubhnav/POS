a. Data Synchronization Strategy

Local-first Storage: Use IndexedDB to store orders, inventory, and menu items locally on each device.
All mutations (add/modify/delete) are written to a local queue and flagged as pendingSync.

Sync Engine: On connection detection, a background sync service pushes queued changes to the central server via REST APIs.
Pulls latest server updates since last sync.

Orders: New and updated orders are queued locally, then pushed.
Orders receive a temporary local ID, reconciled with server ID upon sync.

Inventory: Use versioning (timestamps or incrementing version numbers) to track changes. Pull diffs, merge locally; push local edits when online.

Menu items: Server is the source of truth. Local edits (e.g., price changes) are rareâ€”force a conflict dialog if detected during sync.

b. Conflict Resolution

Last-Write-Wins for simple fields. Use timestamps to decide.
Merge for Complex Data: For objects (e.g., order with items), merge changes if edits are non-overlapping; else flag for manual conflict resolution.
Audit Logs: Keep local edit logs for context if rollback/undo is needed.
User Prompts: UI prompts user when conflicts cannot be resolved automatically.
c. Ensuring Consistency

Sync Tokens: Each sync operation tags data with a version/hash.
Atomic Sync: Transactions push/pull atomically; partial syncs are retried.
Event Subscriptions: Devices receive local push updates (WebSocket/multicast on local network) for orders/inventory changes, ensuring near-realtime consistency.


2. Performance Constraints

a. Optimizing JS Bundle & Performance

Tree-shake unused code, split bundles by feature, lazy-load noncritical modules.
Compress using gzip/brotli.
Only include essential polyfills targeting lowest supported browsers/tablets.
Replace moment.js/lodash with native APIs or ultralight alternatives.
Inline small images as SVGs/icons where feasible.

b. Efficient DOM & Memory Management
Virtualize long lists for catalog (flatlist).
Batch DOM updates, avoid layout thrashing.
Use keyed updates for tables/lists.
Release event listeners/unused objects during teardown to avoid leaks.
Limit large in-memory objects, pull only visible data (pagination/windowing).

3. Multi-Device Coordination

a. Real-time Order Status Sync

Use WebSockets on LAN  for fast, direct communication when online.

Offline: Devices flag changes locally. Upon reconnection, broadcast pending state updates.
Use an event-driven store (EventEmitter pattern, react-redux action) to notify UI components.

b. Print Job Queuing

Central PrintJobManager manages a queue persisted in IndexedDB.
Devices send print job requests; queue processes in FIFO order, batching jobs per device.
If printer is busy/offline, jobs are kept in queue with retry logic and exponential backoff.
Status (queued, sending, done, failed) logged and broadcast to all devices.
c. Device Discovery & Pairing


4. Data Storage Strategy

a. IndexedDB vs WebSQL vs localStorage

Storage	 Pros	Cons
IndexedDB	Fast, async, supports large/binary data, indexes	Complex API
WebSQL	Deprecated, limited browser support	Not future-proof
localStorage	Simple, but sync and size limits (5MB), blocking	

b. Efficient Local Querying

Build secondary indexes in IndexedDB for common fields (SKU, name, category).
Use text-search libraries  for client-side search.
For large catalogs, implement paginated queries and virtualize result rendering.

c. Data Pruning Strategy

Limit cached orders/inventory logs to the last X days/batch.
Remove "completed" orders older than N days.
Use LRU (least-recently-used) logic for cache eviction.
Periodic background pruning process runs during idle time.
